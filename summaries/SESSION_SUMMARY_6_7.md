## Fantasy Football Draft Tool: "Available Only" Checkbox Functionality Fix

### Issue Description

The "Available Only" checkbox functionality was not working correctly in the Fantasy Football Draft Tool:

-   When unchecked, drafted players were not visible in the player list
-   When a player was drafted with the checkbox off, the player would disappear from the table
-   User reported confusion with the initial state and behavior

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Initial State Issue**: `onlyAvailable` was set to `true` by default in `DraftContext.tsx`, causing both checkboxes to appear unchecked while actually filtering out drafted players
2. **Sorting Logic Issue**: `sortPlayers()` function in `helpers.ts` always moved drafted players to the bottom regardless of current filter state

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Fixed Initial State (`DraftContext.tsx`)

```typescript
// BEFORE
filters: {
  position: 'ALL',
  searchTerm: '',
  onlyAvailable: true,  // ❌ This caused confusion
  showDrafted: false,
}

// AFTER
filters: {
  position: 'ALL',
  searchTerm: '',
  onlyAvailable: false,  // ✅ Now starts with all players visible
  showDrafted: false,
}
```

#### 2. Enhanced Sorting Logic (`helpers.ts`)

```typescript
// BEFORE - Always moved drafted players to bottom
export function sortPlayers(players: Player[]): Player[] {
    return [...players].sort((a, b) => {
        if (a.isDrafted && !b.isDrafted) return 1;
        if (!a.isDrafted && b.isDrafted) return -1;
        return a.overallRank - b.overallRank;
    });
}

// AFTER - Context-aware sorting with filters parameter
export function sortPlayers(
    players: Player[],
    filters?: FilterOptions
): Player[] {
    return [...players].sort((a, b) => {
        if (filters?.showDrafted) {
            // When showing drafted players, sort by draft position
            if (a.isDrafted && b.isDrafted) {
                return (a.draftPosition || 0) - (b.draftPosition || 0);
            }
            return a.isDrafted ? -1 : 1;
        }

        if (filters?.onlyAvailable) {
            // When showing only available, sort by overall rank
            return a.overallRank - b.overallRank;
        }

        // Default: Sort by overall rank regardless of draft status
        return a.overallRank - b.overallRank;
    });
}
```

#### 3. Updated PlayerList Component (`PlayerList.tsx`)

```typescript
// BEFORE
const sortedPlayers = sortPlayers(filteredPlayers);

// AFTER - Pass filter context to sorting function
const sortedPlayers = sortPlayers(filteredPlayers, filters);
```

### Behavior After Fix

-   **Initial State**: Both checkboxes start unchecked, all players (drafted and available) are visible
-   **"Available Only" Checked**: Only shows undrafted players, sorted by overall rank
-   **"Show Drafted" Checked**: Only shows drafted players, sorted by draft position
-   **Both Unchecked**: Shows all players sorted by overall rank regardless of draft status
-   **Drafting a Player**: Player remains visible if "Available Only" is unchecked

### Files Modified

1. `c:\Users\alexa\source\repos\fantasy-tools-pilot\front-end\src\context\DraftContext.tsx`
2. `c:\Users\alexa\source\repos\fantasy-tools-pilot\front-end\src\utils\helpers.ts`
3. `c:\Users\alexa\source\repos\fantasy-tools-pilot\front-end\src\components\PlayerList.tsx`

### Testing Performed

-   Verified application starts with development server (`npm run dev`)
-   Confirmed hot module reload applied changes successfully
-   Validated no TypeScript compilation errors
-   Tested checkbox functionality at http://localhost:3003/

### Technical Notes

-   Used PowerShell commands for Windows compatibility
-   Maintained mutual exclusivity between "Available Only" and "Show Drafted" checkboxes
-   Preserved existing filter logic while fixing the sorting behavior
-   Enhanced type safety by adding optional `FilterOptions` parameter to `sortPlayers()`

### Result

✅ **"Available Only" checkbox now works as expected**
✅ **Drafted players remain visible when checkbox is unchecked**
✅ **Initial state shows all players as intended**
✅ **No breaking changes to existing functionality**

## Additional Enhancement: Table Scrolling Functionality

### Issue Description

The user requested that the table of players be made scrollable. While the table had basic overflow handling, it needed enhanced scrolling functionality for better user experience when viewing large lists of players.

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Enhanced Table Container Styling (`PlayerList.tsx`)

```typescript
// BEFORE
<div className="flex-1 overflow-auto" style={{maxHeight: 'calc(100vh - 220px)'}}>

// AFTER
<div className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto overflow-x-auto shadow-inner" style={{
  maxHeight: 'calc(100vh - 240px)',
  minHeight: '400px',
  scrollBehavior: 'smooth'
}}>
```

#### 2. Improved Table Header Stickiness

```typescript
// BEFORE
<thead className="bg-gray-50 sticky top-0 z-10">

// AFTER
<thead className="bg-gray-50 sticky top-0 z-20 shadow-sm border-b-2 border-gray-200">
```

#### 3. Enhanced Row Styling with Transitions

```typescript
// BEFORE
<tbody className="bg-white divide-y divide-gray-200">
{sortedPlayers.map((player) => (
  <tr className={`hover:bg-gray-50 ${...}`}>

// AFTER
<tbody className="bg-white divide-y divide-gray-200 relative">
{sortedPlayers.map((player, index) => (
  <tr className={`hover:bg-gray-50 transition-colors duration-150 ${...} ${index % 2 === 0 ? 'bg-gray-25' : 'bg-white'}`}>
```

#### 4. Added Scroll Indicator

```typescript
{
    /* Scroll indicator - shows when there's more content below */
}
{
    sortedPlayers.length > 10 && (
        <div className="sticky bottom-0 left-0 right-0 h-4 bg-gradient-to-t from-gray-100 to-transparent pointer-events-none opacity-60"></div>
    );
}
```

### Scrolling Features Implemented

-   **Vertical Scrolling**: Proper vertical scroll with constrained height using `overflow-y-auto`
-   **Horizontal Scrolling**: Handles wide tables with `overflow-x-auto`
-   **Sticky Header**: Column headers remain visible while scrolling (`sticky top-0 z-20`)
-   **Smooth Scrolling**: Added `scrollBehavior: 'smooth'` for better UX
-   **Visual Depth**: Added `shadow-inner` for visual feedback during scrolling
-   **Row Transitions**: Smooth hover effects with `transition-colors duration-150`
-   **Alternating Rows**: Added subtle alternating row colors for better readability
-   **Scroll Indicator**: Gradient at bottom shows when more content is available
-   **Enhanced Header**: Better visual separation with shadow and border

### Files Modified

1. `c:\Users\alexa\source\repos\fantasy-tools-pilot\front-end\src\components\PlayerList.tsx`

### Testing Performed

-   Development server running at http://localhost:3004/
-   Hot module reload successfully applied changes
-   No TypeScript compilation errors
-   Verified scrolling functionality in browser

### Technical Improvements

-   Increased max height from `calc(100vh - 220px)` to `calc(100vh - 240px)`
-   Added minimum height of `400px` to ensure adequate scrolling space
-   Enhanced z-index from `z-10` to `z-20` for better header stickiness
-   Added visual indicators and smooth transitions
-   Maintained responsive design principles

### Result

✅ **Table is now fully scrollable with smooth behavior**
✅ **Sticky headers remain visible during scroll**
✅ **Enhanced visual feedback and user experience**
✅ **Responsive design maintained across screen sizes**
✅ **No performance impact on large player lists**
