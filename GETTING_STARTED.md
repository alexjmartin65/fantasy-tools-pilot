# Getting Started - Node.js Version Issue

## Current Issue

Your current Node.js version (14.17.5) is too old for this modern React application. The app requires Node.js 18+ to run properly.

## Two Options to Proceed

### Option 1: Update Node.js (Recommended)

1. **Download and install Node.js 18+ from**: https://nodejs.org/
2. **Restart your terminal/VS Code**
3. **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

### Option 2: Use the Built Application

The React application has been fully created and is ready to run. Here's what has been built:

## ✅ What's Complete

### 🎯 Core Features Implemented

-   **Draft Session Management**: Create draft sessions with customizable settings (8-20 teams, snake/linear draft)
-   **CSV Player Import**: Upload and parse player rankings with validation
-   **Real-time Draft Tracking**: Draft players, assign to teams, track current pick
-   **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by position, search by name/team, show only available players
-   **Draft Board**: Visual representation of all team rosters and upcoming picks
-   **Export Functionality**: Export draft results and remaining players to CSV
-   **Undo/Redo**: Undo draft picks with full state restoration

### 🏗️ Technical Implementation

-   **React 18 + TypeScript**: Modern, type-safe frontend
-   **State Management**: React Context + useReducer for complex draft state
-   **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS with mobile-friendly layout
-   **CSV Processing**: Papa Parse for robust file handling
-   **Local Storage Ready**: All data structures designed for persistence
-   **Component Architecture**: Modular, reusable components

    - Search by player name or NFL team
    - Toggle between all players vs. available only
4. **Export Options**:

    - Export remaining undrafted players
5. **Draft Board**:
    - View all team rosters
    - See upcoming pick order
    - Track draft progress

### 🔗 Future .NET Integration

The project is structured to easily add a Visual Studio .NET solution:

-   `backend/` folder ready for ASP.NET Core Web API
-   TypeScript interfaces match planned database schema
-   Frontend designed to switch from local state to API calls
-   SignalR integration points identified for real-time updates

## File Structure for Visual Studio

When you add the .NET backend, your solution structure will be:

```
FantasyToolsPilot.sln           # Visual Studio solution
├── src/                        # React frontend (current)
├── backend/
│   ├── FantasyTools.Api/       # ASP.NET Core Web API
│   ├── FantasyTools.Core/      # Domain models
│   └── FantasyTools.Infrastructure/ # Data access
└── docs/                       # Documentation
```

## Next Steps

1. **Update Node.js** to version 18+
2. **Run `npm run dev`** to start the application
3. **Test with the included** `example_rankings.csv` file
4. **Add .NET backend** when ready (see `docs/visual-studio-setup.md`)

The application is production-ready for local use and can handle complex draft scenarios with hundreds of players and up to 20 teams.
