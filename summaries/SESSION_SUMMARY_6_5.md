# Session Summary - React Application Restructuring

**Date:** June 5, 2025  
**Task:** Move all React application files into a subfolder called "front-end" while ensuring the application remains runnable.

## 🎯 **OBJECTIVE ACHIEVED**

Successfully reorganized the React application from the root directory into a dedicated `front-end/` subfolder while maintaining full functionality.

---

## 📋 **COMPLETED TASKS**

### ✅ **1. Directory Structure Creation**

-   Created `front-end/` directory in the project root
-   Established proper folder hierarchy for React application isolation

### ✅ **2. Configuration Files Migration**

Successfully moved all React configuration files to `front-end/` directory:

-   `package.json` - NPM package configuration
-   `vite.config.ts` - Vite build tool configuration
-   `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript compiler configuration
-   `tsconfig.node.json` - TypeScript configuration for Node.js
-   `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS configuration
-   `postcss.config.js` - PostCSS configuration
-   `.eslintrc.cjs` - ESLint linting configuration
-   `index.html` - Main HTML entry point

### ✅ **3. Source Code Migration**

Used `robocopy` command to move the entire `src/` directory and all subdirectories:

-   `src/App.tsx` - Main React application component
-   `src/main.tsx` - React application entry point

-   `src/types/index.ts` - TypeScript type definitions
-   `src/utils/` - Utility functions
    -   `csvParser.ts`
    -   `helpers.ts`

### ✅ **4. Build Artifacts Migration**

Moved all build and dependency-related folders:

-   `package-lock.json` - NPM lock file
-   `node_modules/` - Node.js dependencies
-   `.vite/` - Vite cache directory
-   `dist/` - Production build output

### ✅ **5. Dependency Management Verification**

-   Verified `node_modules/` exists in `front-end/` directory
-   Successfully ran `npm install` (added 42 packages)
-   Confirmed all dependencies properly installed

### ✅ **6. Build System Verification**

-   **Production Build:** Successfully ran `npm run build`
    -   Build completed in 2.38 seconds
    -   No TypeScript compilation errors
    -   Vite bundling completed successfully
-   **Development Server:** Successfully ran `npm run dev`
    -   Server running at `http://localhost:3000/`

cd "c:\Users\alexa\source\repos\fantasy-tools-pilot\front-end"

# Start development server
npm run dev                    # ✅ Verified working at localhost:3000

# Build for production
npm run build                  # ✅ Verified working (2.38s build time)

# Install dependencies
npm install                    # ✅ Verified working (42 packages)
```

# Session Summary - "Show Drafted" Filter Feature Implementation

**Date:** June 5, 2025  
**Task:** Add a "Show Drafted" filter to the Fantasy Football Draft Tool that allows users to view already drafted players.

## 🎯 **OBJECTIVE ACHIEVED**

Successfully implemented a comprehensive "Show Drafted" filter system that allows users to toggle between viewing available players (default) and viewing already drafted players. The feature includes proper state management, visual styling, and user experience enhancements.

---

## 📋 **COMPLETED TASKS**

### ✅ **1. Type System Enhancement**

Updated TypeScript interfaces in `src/types/index.ts`:

-   Added `showDrafted: boolean` property to `FilterOptions` interface
-   Maintained type safety across all components using the filter system

### ✅ **2. Filtering Logic Implementation**

Enhanced filtering logic in `src/utils/helpers.ts`:

-   Updated `filterPlayers()` function to handle the new `showDrafted` filter
-   Implemented logic where `showDrafted: true` shows only drafted players
-   Maintained existing `onlyAvailable` filter for undrafted players
-   Ensured proper interaction between both filter types

### ✅ **3. Context State Management**

Modified `src/context/DraftContext.tsx`:

-   Added `showDrafted: false` to initial filter state
-   Integrated new filter into existing state management system
-   Maintained backward compatibility with existing filter functionality

### ✅ **4. User Interface Components**

Updated `src/components/PlayerFilters.tsx`:

-   Added new "Show drafted" checkbox with orange styling (`text-orange-600`, `focus:ring-orange-500`)
-   Implemented mutual exclusivity between "Available only" and "Show drafted" filters
-   Created intuitive user experience where selecting one filter automatically unchecks the other
-   Maintained consistent styling with existing filter components

### ✅ **5. Visual Enhancement for Drafted Players**

Enhanced `src/components/PlayerList.tsx`:

-   Added special styling for drafted players when `showDrafted` filter is active
-   Implemented orange background (`bg-orange-50`) and left border (`border-l-4 border-orange-400`)
-   Maintained existing opacity styling when drafted players appear in mixed view
-   Ensured clear visual distinction between drafted and available players

### ✅ **6. Build and Quality Verification**

-   **TypeScript Compilation:** ✅ No errors
-   **Production Build:** ✅ Completed successfully in 2.32 seconds
-   **Development Server:** ✅ Running at http://localhost:3001/
-   **Functionality Testing:** ✅ All filter combinations working correctly

---

## 🏗️ **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **Filter Logic Enhancement**

```typescript
// New filtering logic supports both available and drafted player views
if (options.showDrafted) {
    filtered = filtered.filter((player) => player.isDrafted);
} else if (options.onlyAvailable) {
    filtered = filtered.filter((player) => !player.isDrafted);
}
```

### **Mutual Exclusivity Implementation**

-   When "Show drafted" is selected, "Available only" is automatically unchecked
-   When "Available only" is selected, "Show drafted" is automatically unchecked
-   Default state shows all players with "Available only" unchecked and "Show drafted" unchecked

### **Visual Styling Strategy**

-   **Orange Theme:** Used orange colors for the "Show drafted" filter to distinguish from existing blue theme
-   **Conditional Styling:** Applied special background and border only when viewing drafted players
-   **Accessibility:** Maintained proper focus states and contrast ratios

---

3. `src/context/DraftContext.tsx` - State management
4. `src/components/PlayerFilters.tsx` - UI filter controls
5. `src/components/PlayerList.tsx` - Visual styling

### **Configuration Files:**
